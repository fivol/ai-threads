# AI Threads - Agent Rules

## Development Workflow

- **Commit after each feature**: After completing each feature or fix, create a git commit with a descriptive message.

## Code Quality

- Write SOLID, DRY, readable, maintainable code
- Prefer simple code over complex solutions
- Search and reuse existing components or util functions before creating new ones

## Communication

- If a solution or task seems suboptimal, propose a better approach and ask before implementing
- Answer questions without implementing immediately unless explicitly asked

## Testing

- Do not run linters or formatters unless explicitly asked
- Do not run 'build' command after edits unless explicitly asked
